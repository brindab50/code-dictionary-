  outside the method. You will see more details about method in subsequent chapter. Local 
  variables begin with a lowercase letter or _.", language: l1)
t5 = Term.create!(name: "Instance Variables", content: "Instance variables are available

  to define a global variable. The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($).", language: l1)

t11 = Term.create!(name: "Functions", content: "A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of 
  statements that performs a task or calculates a value.It is like a reusable piece of code.
  Imagine , having 20 for loops ,and then having a single function to handle it all . To use a 
  function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. A function 
  definition (also called a function declaration) consists of the function keyword, followed by 
  the name of the function, a list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated 
  by commas, the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, { }.", language: l2)
t12 = Term.create!(name: "Function Hoisting", content: "The two ways of declaring functions produce

   and makes it available before it’s actually defined.", language: l2)
t13 = Term.create!(name: "Anonymous", content: "When something or someone is referred to as

  Let's see the add functions below for example.", language: l2)
t15 = Term.create!(name: "Hoisting", content: "Hoist means to raise something. Hoisting in JavaScript 
  also means the same and what gets raised is the declaration (variable & function declarations). 
  Declarations are where variables and functions are created with keywords var (not for global) and function. 
  It doesn't matter where you type the code to declare a function or variable, during evaluation all the 
  declarations are moved up inside the scope where they reside (except for in strict mode). Hence, it's 
  possible to write a working code with the code for function call placed before function declaration.", language: l2)
t16 = Term.create!(name: "Mutation", content: "Mutation means change or modification. If you ever come 
  across the word mutation in JavaScript it's probably referring to the changes that DOM elements went through.
  There's even an API called MutationObserver to keep an eye out for the DOM mutations like addition of 
  child elements or changes to the element's attributes.", language: l2)
t17 = Term.create!(name: "Vanilla", content: "Vanilla is considered a traditional standard flavor. 
  Vanilla JavaScript is referred to the standard JavaScript — no framework. Vanilla in fact isn't only 
  used to describe the standard version of JavaScript but also other languages like CSS.", language: l2)
t18 = Term.create!(name: "Pragma", content: "Pragma is short for pragmatic information. In plain English, 
  pragmatic is an adjective that means sensible and practical. In programming, pragma refers to the code 
  that consist of useful information on how a compiler or interpreter or assembler should process the program.
  It does not contribute anything to the programming language itself and its syntax may vary. They only 
  affect the compiler behavior. JavaScript also has few pragmas, one of them is strict.", language: l2)
t19 = Term.create!(name: "Variadic", content: "Variadic is an adjective created by joining 'variable' and 
  'adicity'. 'Adicity' is from ancient Greek, with a meaning that's the same as the Latin word 'arity' 
  (Item 1 in this list). Thus, the term variadic is used to express something that has variable number of arguments.
  In JavaScript, a variadic function takes in any number of arguments. It can be created using arguments property, 
  apply method and since ES6, the spread operator. Below is an example using a spread operator.", language: l2)
